Example 2
^^^^^^^^^

Description
"""""""""""

Example that constructs a 3x3 discrete-time Markov chain then computes the transient distribution for a number of steps and an initial distribution given as parameters to the application. Usage:

.. code-block:: bash

   example2 <n> <p1> <p2> <p3>

Here, n is the number of steps for the simulation, and p1, p2, p3 are the respective initial probabilities of the three states.

Tasks performed
"""""""""""""""

* create a ``DiscreteDistribution`` object to hold the initial distribution of the process
* create a ``SparseMatrix`` object to hold the transition matrix of the chain, entry by entry with the ``addToEntry()`` function;
* create a ``MarkovChain`` object and link the previous elements to it;
* output the Markov chain object to the screen;
* compute the distribution of the Markov chain after n steps and store it in a ``Distribution`` object;
* write the distribution to the screen;
* clean up.

Output
""""""

The output consists in:

 * the code of the Markov chain: matrix and initial distribution (see also example 1)
 * the representation of the discrete distribution in the ``Marmote`` format: 1) the list of "states" of the distribution (here, the integer interval [0..2]); 2) the list of respective probabilities of these states.
